Bubi Radar
==========

Try it out at [bubiradar.net](http://bubiradar.net)

[Bubi](http://molbubi.bkk.hu/) is Budapest's public bike sharing service. It is run by Budapest's public transportation company, [BKK](http://www.bkk.hu/).

Bubi Radar was made as a personal project and uses publically available data about the location of and number of bikes at each station. Bubi Radar is not an official app; as far as I know Bubi or BKK know nothing about it.
